# Ethan Aldama's Portfolio


Hello, my name is Ethan Aldama and I am a first year computer science major at CSUF, and I plan to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120-L Labs

Lab 1

I really enjoyed lab one because everything was still so new and interesting. I think the concept of the Hello World assignment is really good and a great starter for any computer language.

Lab 6, Part 1

This lab holds a special place in my heart because it encapsulated the amount of hard work that goes into understanding code, as well as the satisfaction you get when everything finally goes right. I just wasn't initially able to wrap my head around the concept of indexes and command line arguments. But after hours of trial and error I finally finished and it felt great to do so. 

Lab 9, Part 1

I also liked this lab for similar reasons to lab 6. I find that I get more enjoyment from the Labs that I put more effort into. I also found the concept of calling upon files to like do a check was really interesting, It was something I hadn't seen in previous coding classes and just went to show how much more I have to learn. This was also the first lab in which I felt I was fairly prepared in terms of my notes that I took and resources I used whilst doing the lab.
